# House Sales Prediction

# Dataset Description

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
It's a great dataset for evaluating simple regression models.
I chose this topic is because predicting the expected (house) price is a typical topic for business analyst. I think it is a great chance for us to have hands-on practice.
Along with house price (target) it consists of an ID, date, and 18 house features.
